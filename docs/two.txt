Create a VIEW entitled PREFERRED_CUSTOMERS. The fields in this view will be:

custname
custstreet
custcity
custprov
custpcode
balance
It should include those customers

whose outstanding balance is less than $100 000, and
who have placed two or more sales orders in the past 2 years.
Each customer should show only once.
To find out if the orderdate is in the past twelve months, subtract the orderdate from the current date (SYSDATE) and see if the result is between 0 and 730. (This is an approximate method.)

To find out if a customer's number appears more than once in the SHW.SALESORDER table, do a subquery which only chooses custno from SHW.SALESORDER where the COUNT of custno, grouped by custno is greater than 1. As this is a restriction on the value of a group function, a HAVING clause must be used.
